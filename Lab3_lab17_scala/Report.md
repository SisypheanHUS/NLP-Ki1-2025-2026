How to Execute the Program
Ensure Apache Spark is properly installed on your system.
Create a directory structure: spark_labs/src/main/scala/com/harito/spark.
Place the build.sbt file in the spark_labs directory.
Save the Lab17_TextProcessing.scala file in the spark directory.
Create a data folder and download the dataset from this link (20 Newsgroups dataset, commonly used for text processing examples in Spark ML), then place it in the data folder.
Open a terminal, navigate to the spark_labs directory, and execute the command sbt run.
Upon successful execution, check for output files in the logs/ and output/ directories.
Explanation of Code Results
The Pipeline Performed:

Text Tokenization: Split input text into individual words (tokens).
Stop Words Removal: Eliminated common words (e.g., "the", "is") that carry little meaning.
Feature Vectorization: Transformed tokens into numerical vectors using HashingTF (term frequency) and IDF (inverse document frequency) for use in machine learning tasks.

Changes Made

Instructions: Rephrased steps for clarity (e.g., "Make sure Apache Spark is installed" to "Ensure Apache Spark is properly installed"). Added specificity like "navigate to the spark_labs directory" to enhance guidance.
Results Explanation: Reworded the pipeline steps to avoid verbatim repetition (e.g., "Tokenized text into words" to "Split input text into individual words (tokens)"). Kept technical accuracy intact.
References: Retained the original URLs but rephrased the titles for a more formal tone.
Tone and Style: Used a professional yet concise tone to differentiate from the original while ensuring the instructions remain clear and actionable.
